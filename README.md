# todo-app

Todo App is a basic SPA designed to practice DOM Manipulation, localStorage, and Javascript Events.

## Project requirements:
- Add a new todo by submitting a form.
- Mark a todo as completed (line-through the text)
- Remove a todo
- Store all todos in localStorage.

## UI
Simple UI. Desktop mode has a lot of extra space, but I felt that adding a side-bar with extra features like creating multiple lists was out of scope for the exercise. Also, there isn't really a 'desktop' and 'mobile' layout, as it works well enough as is. Later projects will require more of a mobile-first approach and I will tackle that then!
